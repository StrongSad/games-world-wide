<![CDATA[
<p><strong>[UPDATE]</strong> Epic has responded to our request for comment, confirming the Essentials Edition will contain an Early Access version of Paragon.</p><p>"Paragon Essentials Edition will offer a great value to players who are looking to hop into the game early and get more than $160 of value (based on in-game currency) for only $59.99. The Essentials Edition will be available at retail locations in June, when Paragon is still in Early Access. We're excited to let fans join the fight early as we evolve the game over the coming months and years." </p><p>The original story follows:</p><p>You can play <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/paragon">Paragon</a> right now if you're willing to pay $20 or more for Founder's Packs, though the Epic-developed MOBA will be free-to-play once it leaves Early Access. However, if you want a physical edition of the game on <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/ps4">PS4</a>, you can pay $60 in exchange for skins, five Hero Master Challenges, and in-game currency.</p><p>Epic's senior marketing manager, Wes Phillips, announced the Paragon Essentials Edition on the <a href="http://blog.us.playstation.com/2016/04/25/paragon-essentials-edition-hits-stores-june-7/">PlayStation Blog</a>, where he detailed what players would get for the $60 version of a free-to-play game. The physical retail edition comes with five skins, including the launch-exclusive Wasteland Twinblast skin--Phillips notes that you can only get it in the Essentials Edition "for now."</p><image data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1551/15511094/3053708-26546247595_57bd9c6f63_b.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-3053708" data-ratio="0.55078125" data-width="1024" data-resize-url="http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1551/15511094/3053708-26546247595_57bd9c6f63_b.jpg" data-resized="true"><a href="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1551/15511094/3053708-26546247595_57bd9c6f63_b.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1551/15511094/3053708-26546247595_57bd9c6f63_b.jpg" /></a></image><p>Players will also get 6,000 Paragon coins, which is valued at $60. You can spend the in-game currency on stuff like skins, boosts, Master Challenges, and other items. Additionally, players get Master Challenges for Twinblast, Sevarog, Iggy &amp; Scorch, and two unannounced heroes. These grant a Challenger skin and permanent XP boost, in addition to unlocking rewards like taunts and the Master skin.</p><p>Lastly, players will have five Rep boosts that last for three wins each and speed up the pace at which you earn Rep--it can be spent on card packs and Master Challenges, among other things.</p><p>It's unclear if the Essentials Edition will include a completed version of Paragon or if it will feature the game in its current Early Access state. We've reached out to Epic and will update this story as more information becomes available.</p><p>Paragon Essentials Edition releases for PS4 on June 7. Those who preorder get an additional 1,000 Paragon Coins.</p><p>You can currently buy into Paragon on PC and PS4 with digital Founder's Packs that cost $20, $60, and $100. The $60 Challenger Founder's Pack gets you 13 Master Challenges, as opposed to the Essential Edition's five. It also gets you five weeks of three-win Rep boosts, a Hotrod Howitzer skin, and a $20 Founder's Pack for a friend.

<title>Severed Review</title>
<link>
http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/severed-review/1900-6416415/
</link>
<description>
<![CDATA[
<p>Drinkbox Studios' games all share a unique, rather dark sense of humor and very distinctive artistic flare. With Severed, the studio has turned its attention to classic first-person dungeon crawling, and the result is a creative touch-screen adventure with sharp, colorful graphics that mask an incredibly dark center.</p><p dir="ltr">Severed places you in the role of Sasha. Her home burned, her family taken, and her left-arm severed, she wakes up to find everything she loves destroyed. When a mysterious and frightful vision bestows her with a living sword that sucks up power by severing limbs, Sasha ventures forth into a nightmarish maze in search of a resolution.</p><p dir="ltr">While Severed is heavily influenced by classic dungeon crawlers, it’s not exactly an RPG. Sasha doesn’t have traditional stats that increase throughout the game. Instead, you use the body parts collected during combat--and occasionally find strewn about the environment--as currency to buy or upgrade abilities, which include increased damage and health, the ability to leech health from enemies, or a longer window of time to sever limbs during combat, to name a few. Each new ability and piece of armor Sasha earns by killing a boss has its own upgrade tree, so there’s a good amount of depth to the customization system overall. If you prefer to rely on straightforward sword-slashing, you can focus heavily on that skill tree, but there's plenty of room to experiment with Sasha's repertoire of equipment and abilities.</p><image data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/3054107-severed_screenshot_07.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-3054107"

swiping over enemies to attack or to parry incoming attacks in real time, but within that basic framework, Drinkbox has created a rewarding system where every move counts as you seek to collect body parts for new upgrades. Monsters' attacks are tied to a cooldown timer, and you can successfully counter them by swiping toward an attacking appendage. When done successfully, this will open monsters up to consecutive attacks. Facing a monster one-on-one is usually not a problem, but Severed doesn’t make it that easy—the game frequently throws three or four monsters at you at once. This means you have to keep a very close watch on the timer for each monster and shift your focus accordingly in order to attack and defend at the right time.</p><p dir="ltr">Timing is everything in Severed: the only way to collect body parts is to fill your sever meter by consistently attacking without being blocked, and, by parrying incoming attacks. Screwing up your timing or the angle of your swipe may lead to a blocked attack, which in turn prevents your meter from filling up. You may still win the fight, but you will walk away empty-handed. Combat can quickly become a hectic, even stressful affair. Thankfully, there are no random encounters here. Severed lets you know where the monsters are with a glowing flame in the room ahead. There’s also no real penalty to dying in the normal difficulty level.</p><p dir="ltr">Severed's map bears more than a passing resemblance to Metroid-style games. The overall world is quite large, but the meat of the game is figuring out how to reach new, tucked away areas. Much like Metroid, this is usually done by defeating a boss and earning a new ability. Sasha can learn how to change the land from day to night and back again to open special doors, for instance.</p><image data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/3054096-severed_screenshot_11.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-3054096" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-resize-url="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/3054096-severed_screenshot_11.jpg" data-resized="true">Sasha must cross hellish landscapes during her journey, but even at its most sinister, Severed sneaks in brilliant splashes of color.</image><p dir="ltr">This is a world that takes you through spooky forests, forgotten temples, fiery wastelands, and more in Sasha’s quest to find her family. The landscapes are equally dreamlike and nightmarish, with bizarre plant growths and areas defined by isolation and ruin. There’s an intriguing use of organic shapes and objects throughout. A giant skull might be resting along a forest path, and within the dungeons, the actual doors are frequently living creatures—scary, toothsome maws that open when given the right object. At one point, you’ll go through a living door, only to find it’s still connected to an actual creature—some huge, worm-like thing that produces foul toxic gas. The whole world of Severed is full of strange sights that make it worthwhile to comb every inch of its multi-level maps.</p><p dir="ltr">Severed starts out deceptively simplistic and bizarre. The weird, old-school scrolling method and touch-based interactions hide a remarkably deep and involving mix of action, adventure, and role-playing. The more hours you pour into Severed, the more complex it becomes and the darker the story gets. It takes a while to grasp, but once the game picks up steam, it becomes an intriguing experience that's unlike any other game on Vita to date.</p>

<![CDATA[
raised a lot of questions about the movie, coming to theaters on May 27. We have some questions too and possibly some answers relating back to the X-Men comic book series.</p><p>While this shot of Apocalypse, Magneto, Angel, Psylocke, and Storm isn't the opening of the trailer, it certainly is one of the coolest moments as we see a "hero shot" of the villains of the film. The biggest question this raised is "why is Magneto working with Apocalypse?" Magneto isn't the best at working with others when he's not in control. Maybe his body language here shows a little bit of reluctance.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>What's Going on with Apocalypse Here?</h2><img src="http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/3053713-1.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>We first see the titular villain of the film, as a human, laying on a bed. A blue energy surrounds him and changes him into a more familiar look. What's happening to him? In the comics, Apocalypse already had blue-grey skin; however, he used alien technology to enhance himself. Most likely, that's what's happening here. The biggest question from this scene is "how many of his powers are from the alien tech?"</p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>Why are Charles' Eyes Blacked Out?</h2><img src="http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/3053714-2.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>While Charles is using Cerebro, his eyes go black, as he reaches a very powerful mutant. Why would that happen to him? Apocalypse has telepathy, so maybe this was Apocalypse pushing back against the Professor. Apocalypse may be the most powerful telepathic mutant on Earth if he can do this to Professor X. </p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>Why are Nightcrawler and Angel Fighting?</h2><img src="http://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/3053756-9.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Angel and Nightcrawler are fighting in a cage with a crowd looking on. Could this be how Apocalypse picks who is worthy to become one of his horsemen? No clue, but if Nightcrawler never wanted to fight, which it seems like, why did he get into the cage in the first place. It's pretty easy to escape any situation when you can just "BAMF" out.</p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>Why is Apocalypse Growing that Large?</h2><img src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/3053716-3.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>At one point, Charles tries to punch Apocalypse, who is a normal-sized person. Apocalypse grabs Charles' fist and starts growing to a point where his hand is larger than the Professor's. Apocalypse has a ton of mutant powers in the comics. The one power he uses more than any other is the ability to grow. This is different than Ant-Man's ability to shrink and grow though. Apocalypse has control over his molecular structure, so in addition to growing and shrinking, he can shape-shift as well.</p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>What Makes Mystique Rejoin the X-Men?</h2><img src="http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/3053717-4.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>With Professor X out of commission, assuming that Apocalypse took him out, we see Beast and Mystique walking through the underground of the X-Mansion and discussing starting the team back up. While Beast has been a true friend to the X-Men, standing by Charles' side, Mystique has jumped ship a few times, so what makes her come back to the fold? There's no solid answers here, but it could be because Charles is hurt and needs someone to take his place. Mystique is his oldest friend, so why not her?</p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>Magneto has a Family?</h2><img src="http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/3053718-5.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Peter is talking to Mystique and lets her know that Magneto is his father. This was alluded to in <em>X-Men: Days of Future Past</em>. It's true. Magneto has a family and Quicksilver has a sister, who was in a deleted scene of the last film. Ignoring the recent Quicksilver retcons that took place last year, which we suspect were done for movie rights purposes, everything Quicksilver says here is true, and his sister is Scarlet Witch, who you may have seen in <em>Avengers: Age of Ultron</em>.</p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>What Role Will Jubilee have?</h2><img src="http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/3053761-11.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>We very briefly see Jubilee, played by Lana Condor, start to stand up. X-Men fans have been waiting for quite some time to see this character appear in one of the X-films, for more than 10 seconds in the background. However, she's not on the movie posters and has very little screen time in the trailers. Will she be a background character once again?</p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>Why Does Angel have Metal Wings here?</h2><img src="http://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/3053719-6.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>In most of what we've seen of Angel in the trailer for the film, he's had bird-like feathers on his wings. However, here, Angel is sporting metal wings. In the comics, Apocalypse liked to enhance his horsemen before sending them into battle. He gave Angel sharp, metal wings and blue-skin. It seems like that could happen again here. </p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>Why is Havok using his Powers in Cerebro?</h2><img src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/3053720-7.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Cerebro is the machine Professor X uses to enhance his power and to find more mutants around the world. We see Havok blasting something or someone in one moment of the trailer. Why is he doing this? Considering that Cerebro is incredibly powerful, our guess is that Apocalypse wants it, especially since we saw him at the X-Mansion earlier in the trailer. Havok is probably defending Charles and Cerebro here.</p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>How does Wolverine have Metal Claws Now?</h2><img src="http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/3053721-8.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>At the end of <em>Days of Future Past</em>, Wolverine is fished out of the river by Stryker, the man who put Wolverine into the Weapon X program. However, it was actually Mystique impersonating Styker at the end of the film, so how did Wolverine get those metal claws? Our guess is that even though Mystique saved him, he still goes into the program and gets experimented on. From what we see, we may even get to see Wolverine as Weapon X, berserker rage and all. </p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>Is that Actually Stryker?</h2><img src="http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/3053760-10.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>As mentioned, Mystique was posing as Stryker in <em>Days of Future Past</em>, so when Stryker pops up towards the end of the <i>Apocalypse</i> trailer, we're all wondering in the back of our minds, "is it actually him?" Considering we got some shots of the Canadian wilderness, followed by Wolverine with metal claws, we're assuming this is actually him and we'll get to see Wolverine's origin again, but this time, he won't be fighting Baraka with his mouth sewn shut. </p></h3></p><br/>

<title>Ashes of the Singularity Review</title>

<description>
<![CDATA[
<p>At times, I can't help but marvel at Ashes of the Singularity. Watching a battlefield gradually pack in thousands of hover-tanks and carriers as supply lines stretch and groan to support massive war efforts is intoxicating. There's a wonderment here that begs you to grasp at what commanding a continent-spanning conflict might feel like. At that scale, the subtle movements of fighter squadrons and the flashes of canon fire yield to larger vistas, and you can feel the game's pulse as wave after wave of enemies cascade across your screen. Impressive though it may be, peeling away the lustrous exterior reveals that Ashes of the Singularity is a surprisingly hollow game, with few novel ideas to support its scale.</p><p dir="ltr">It plays like many of its peers: you build out a base, collect resources, and engage in combat. It's a basic framework that underpins everything from <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/starcraft">Starcraft</a> to <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/rise-of-nations">Rise of Nations</a>. The core problem is there is little to appreciate beyond how busy Ashes of the Singularity's battles become. When it comes to forming a strategy, there are few opportunities to develop nuanced tactics.</p><video data-embed-type="video" data-ref-id="2300-6429167" data-src="/videos/ashes-of-the-singularity-massive-and-micro-scale-g/2300-6429167/" data-width="100%" data-height="100%"></video><p dir="ltr">You have three main resources to manage--metal, radiactives, and turinium. The first two are for constructing ships, but if you collect enough turinium you win the game. Because turinium is necessary for victory, Ashes of the Singularity encourages hapless and aggressive rushing. Your starting area will only have a couple resource nodes, and you can't stockpile resources as you can in most other strategy games. So, playing cautiously isn't an option. You have to expand--and fast.</p><p dir="ltr">This exacerbates some of Ashes of the Singularity's other problems. As I churned out endless streams of robotic warriors, I noticed that they all looked similar, especially when I pulled the camera all the way out and the battlefield melted together in the mélange of war machines. Pressing to gain more and more ground kept me from developing any familiarity with my units, which is unfortunate given you only have about a dozen unique types to work with. Each frigate looks indistinguishable from the last, making it hard to keep track of which units you have and which ones you still need.</p><blockquote data-size="large" data-align="center"><p dir="ltr">With the exception of modest changes in elevation, there aren't many features that lend themselves to strategic use.</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">Maps are consistently dry and lack character. With the exception of modest changes in elevation, there aren't many features that lend themselves to strategic use. There are no towering mountains to hide your forces during an ambush, no rare or unique resources to exploit, nor any obstacles to slow down foes. Every unit and building works the same regardless of placement on the map, and as you build out a network of resource nodes, you'll see the same desolate brown textures again and again.</p><image data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/3053576-ashes3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-3053576" data-ratio="0.56770833333333" data-width="1920" data-resize-url="http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_super/1406/14063904/3053576-ashes3.jpg" data-resized="true">Ashes of the Singularity does a great job of communicating the massive scale of its conflicts.</image><image data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/3053634-ashes2.png" data-ref-id="1300-3053634" data-ratio="0.56542301629007" data-width="1903" data-resize-url="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_small/1406/14063904/3053634-ashes2.png" data-resized="true">The early game doesn't have a lot for you to do or manage.</image><p dir="ltr">You have the ability to organize your legions into "armies," which are supposed to be super-charged control groups. And this works, but only to a point. Forming armies reduced the need to constantly micromanage units, allowing me to focus on the larger plan: pinching off enemy supplies, flanking with the brutality of my dreadnoughts, and dropping strategic weapons of mass destruction. But Ashes of the Singularity still left me with scant few options to conduct my campaign.</p><p dir="ltr">It's hard not to draw comparisons to earlier massive-scope strategy games, namely <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/supreme-commander">Supreme Commander</a>. The parallels between the two run deep and cover everything from their approach to resource collection to their emphasis on massive battles. But, despite being a decade old, Supreme Commander still wears the crown. Rather than rest on the spectacle of massive battles alone, it crucially wove finer pieces into its formula to make those bouts interesting.</p><blockquote data-size="large" data-align="center"><p dir="ltr">There is one-note to this song, and, while beautiful in its own right, Ashes of the singularity is ultimately shallow.</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">Ashes of the Singularity doesn't have these flourishes; what you see is what you get. There is one-note to this song, and, while beautiful in its own right, is ultimately shallow. It's a wonder to see in action, but tedious to play. Scale should be a canvas for battles, not a replacement for a deep set of tools. Instead of providing an intricate network of systems to work with, Ashes of the Singularity cuts itself down, leaving only the most basic elements of the genre intact. You have a handful of units, three resources, and a basic goal. At no point can you leverage anything beyond those basic pieces in a meaningful way. Without more resources, nuanced mechanics, or a charming aesthetic to help carry the experience, Ashes of the Singularity struggles to hold your attention.</p><p dir="ltr">As it stands, Ashes of the Singularity feels like little more than a tech demo of Stardock's new Oxide engine. At best, it demonstrates the power of multicore optimization and DirectX 12, being the latest game to push the limits of computing to render a massive number of moving parts in a burgeoning war machine. Even so, the game comes off as half-finished. There is a decent foundation, but Ashes fails to build on it in a satisfying way.</p><p> </p>

<![CDATA[
<p><img src="http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/3052498-bestintro+copy.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Every week, we take a look at some of the most bizarre, exciting, and downright unique things to happen in comics. Check out our choices below of the strange and wacky things that shouldn't be overlooked from this week's releases.</p><p>There may be some <b><i>tiny spoilers</i></b> ahead.</p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>Astonishing Ant-Man #7</h2><img src="http://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/3052499-antman.jpg" /><br /><h3><p><strong>Best Way to Install Video Cameras</strong></p><p>Sometimes, putting in a security camera can be a hassle, with the ladders and the climbing. Luckily, Ant-Man just enlists the help of Giant Man to do all the dirty work for him.</p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>James Bond #6</h2><img src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/3052505-jamesbond6a.jpg" /><br /><h3><p><strong>Best Display of a Special Bullet</strong></p> <p>Seeing James Bond kick some butt and take down bad guys is pretty cool. However, this issue of <em>James Bond</em> gives readers an X-Ray look of how these bullets went through the enemy's heads.</p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>All-New Hawkeye #6</h2><img src="http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/3052500-allnewhawk6.jpg" /><br /><h3><p><strong>Best Commentary on Hawkeye's Lack of Powers</strong></p><p>It must be tough to be on the Avengers when you're one of the few people without any powers or a suit of armor. Barney talks about Hawkeye's teammates in this scene in a jet plane. </p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>Sam Wilson: Captain America #8</h2><img src="http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/3052501-capsam8.jpg" /><br /><h3><p><strong>Best Reason to be Happy For Young Steve Rogers </strong></p><p>Steve Rogers got his powers and his age back, and one thing that's great about that, for Bucky, is he no longer has to yell or repeat himself.</p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>James Bond #6</h2><img src="http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/3052506-jamesbond6b.jpg" /><br /><h3><p><strong>Best "You Sank my Battleship" Reference</strong></p> <p>The James Bond films are known for their over-the-top plots, the action-packed scenes, and their witty one-liners. Of course, when a giant ship goes down, someone has to make a reference to the Battleship board game.</p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>Sam Wilson: Captain America #8</h2><img src="http://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/3052502-capsam8b.jpg" /><br /><h3><p><strong>Most Disturbing Birthday Party (or best reason to avoid random birthday parties in the woods)</strong></p><p>How do you get an all-powerful being, made up of the cosmic cube but trapped in the body of a child to come to you? Throw it a creepy party in the middle of the forest! Just make sure you have your party hats to make it super-legit. </p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>Shaft: Imitation of Life #3</h2><img src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/3052509-shaft.jpg" /><br /><h3><p><strong>Best Conversation on Dialogue we had to Censor</strong></p> <p>Shaft was hired to be a consultant on a new movie. While discussing a particular line of dialogue, Shaft's expertise is called into play as he tells the actor what the best way to deliver this highly-censored line.</p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>Deadpool #10</h2><img src="http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/3052503-deadpool10.jpg" /><br /><h3><p><strong>Best Reference to Rock Sensation Creed</strong></p><p>To be fair, references to the band Creed should be minimal in comics. Regardless, Deadpool is chasing down Sabretooth, whose real name is Victor Creed, in a sweet motorcycle chase. Deadpool has some words for Creed that he finds to be quite the insult, flipping him the bird.</p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>Grumpy Cat and Pokey #3</h2><img src="http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/3052504-grumpycatpokey3.jpg" /><br /><h3><p><strong>Best Reaction From a Cat Having to go for a Ride</strong></p><p>If you own a dog, then mentioning the word "car" aloud will drive your pup into a frenzy. This week, Grumpy Cat shows us what happens when a cat realizes it has to go for ride.</p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>Chew: Demon Chicken Poyo #1</h2><img src="http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/3052512-chew.jpg" /><br /><h3><p><strong>Best Declaration About the Comic You're Already Reading</strong></p><p>Young Lily has become possessed and a priest is there is there to expel the beast. He'll do so by reading to here from the "good book." The book you're currently reading: <em>Chew: Demon Chicken Poyo</em>. </p><p> </p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>Howard the Duck #6</h2><img src="http://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/3052524-howard6.jpg" /><br /><h3><p><strong>Best Reason Not to Buy the Warranty</strong></p><p>Sometimes, you need a warranty on an expensive item. However, when purchasing a high-powered weapon, Rocket learns that this is one case where you really don't need the warranty because if it breaks, you're dead.</p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>Flash #50</h2><img src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/3052525-flahs1.jpg" /><br /><h3><p><strong>Best Way to Escape from Prison</strong></p><p>There's lots of ways to escape from prison and most of them include well-thought out and elaborate plans. Girder figures the best way to get out is to just kick through a cement wall. </p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>Superman: American Alien #6</h2><img src="http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/3052528-supe1.jpg" /><br /><h3><p><strong>Best Place for Clark Kent to Stand When Greeting Friends</strong></p><p>When Clark's friends come to visit him in Metropolis, Clark decides to stand in front of a giant poster of Superman.

Clark explains why to his friends.</p><p>That's it this week. Let us know in the comments below what other Best Stuff you dug this past week.

in America: Civil War</em>, a change is about to occur. Instead of fighting the enemy, the heroes will fight each other.</p><p>What caused this rift between the comrades in arms? A lot has to do with the public perception of the superheroes and the destruction caused by their encounters with the forces of evil. This destruction feeds into the fear of the people and the government, which leads to a decision that splits the team.</p><p>We map out the events leading up to the strife between the Avengers.</p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>The Incredible Hulk (2008)</h2><img src="http://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1444/14446008/3051918-11a+hulk_vs_abomination.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>In order to stop the threat of the Hulk, Emil Blonsky is injected with an attempt to recreate the Super Soldier Serum. He later has Bruce Banner's gamma-irradiated blood injected into his body after the serum alone isn't enough to stop Hulk. The combination of the two transforms Blonsky into the Abomination. The two monsters fight in Harlem, New York, causing a fair amount of damage. This was the Cinematic Universe's first exposure to the destruction caused by a superhero/supervillain battle.</p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>The Avengers (2012)</h2><img src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1444/14446008/3051919-10+battleny.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>The Hulk/Abomination battle didn't destroy too much of the city. It's possible the government or authorities tried to cover up as much as they could. During the Battle of New York when the Chitauri (and Loki) attacked, there was no way to hide the destruction. The Avengers gathered to deal with, and push back, the threat. Despite this fact, the world would associate the Avengers' presence with the destruction. The world's eyes are now open to the power the Avengers posses.</p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>Thor: The Dark World (2013)</h2><img src="http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1444/14446008/3051920-9b+darkelves-ttdw.png" /><br /><h3><p>The destruction involving the Avengers isn't limited to just New York. When Thor's battle against Malekith spilled over into London, the world has another reason to fear those with superpowers. To make things worse, Thor didn't even bother with any of the clean-up after the fight. S.H.I.E.L.D. had to come in to help.</p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014)</h2><img src="http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1444/14446008/3051921-8b+winter.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>The Winter Soldier showed no remorse or concern for any innocent bystanders when chasing after Captain America, Black Widow, and Falcon. Like many of the other battles, it's not really fair to blame the heroes for any damages or terror a bad guy might cause. It's simply a matter that the public will associate these events with the more familiar heroes that happen to be involved or at the scene. If people weren't afraid before, this showed you couldn't even drive down the street without the possibility of a fight breaking out.</p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014)</h2><img src="http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1444/14446008/3051922-7b+fallshield.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>The destruction of S.H.I.E.L.D. with helicarriers literally falling from the sky was another fearful day in the Cinematic Universe. S.H.I.E.L.D. may have been a government agency but with Avengers like Captain America, Black Widow, and Hawkeye associated with them, this added yet another major incident that could be tied to the Avengers.</p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015)</h2><img src="http://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1444/14446008/3051923-6b+hulkbuster.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>After Hulk is mind-manipulated by Scarlet Witch into going on a rampage in Johannesburg, South Africa, it's up to Iron Man, in his Hulkbuster armor, to stop him. It's a massive fight which results in an incredible amount of damage and destruction to the city. To the world, they simply saw two Avengers brutally fighting each other. The Avengers didn't even try to explain what happened. They simply retreated to a safehouse. How could they explain that their member, who is a ticking timebomb, was mind-controlled? Even if Stark offered to help cover the cost of repairing damages, there's no way to reassure the citizens something like this wouldn't happen again.</p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015)</h2><img src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1444/14446008/3051924-5b+ultron.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> Part of the problem was the creation of Ultron. Tony Stark has long dabbled in creating artificial intelligence. Because of his work, Ultron came to life and decided the best way to save the world was to destroy humans. </p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015)</h2><img src="http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1444/14446008/3051925-4b+sokovia_crater.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>The Battle of New York may have caused damage over blocks of the city, but the Avengers' fight with Ultron ended up in the destruction of the entire city of Sokovia. They may have assisted in evacuating everyone, but how can they feel safe knowing this sort of destruction is becoming a common theme with the Avengers?</p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>Captain America: Civil War (2016)</h2><img src="http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1444/14446008/3051926-3b+accords.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Because of all the destruction, the nations of the world agree there needs to be more accountability from superheroes. Thaddeus Ross, last seen during the Hulk/Abomination battle, is now the U.S. Secretary of State. He approaches Steve Rogers and his newer team of Avengers, stating they can no longer operate as vigilantes with unlimited power. Tony Stark steps forward, agreeing with the Sokovia Accords, which will call for more responsibility. Steve Rogers opposes this view.</p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>Captain America: Civil War (2016)</h2><img src="http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1444/14446008/3051927-2b+black-panther.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> Black Panther is making his Cinematic Universe debut. As the ruler of the nation of Wakanda, he is pulled into the fight between Stark and Rogers when an incident close to home impacts his life.</p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>Captain America: Civil War (2016)</h2><img src="http://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1444/14446008/3051928-1b+spidey.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Spider-Man is also making his debut in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This isn't the Spider-Man we've seen in past films. It appears Tony Stark has a hand in bringing him into the battle. Hopefully he knows what he's getting into.</p></h3></p><br/>

<p><h2>We look at biggest theories from the books and make predictions for HBO's Game of Thrones season 6.</h2><img src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1544/15443861/3052264-69fca9c0-7433-0133-9049-0e17bac22e39.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>It’s almost time. Game of Thrones season 6 kic
]]>
<![CDATA[
ks off this Sunday, and if you saw our recent <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/gallery/game-of-thrones-season-6-character-catch-up-where-/2900-623">season 5 recap</a>, you should have a pretty good idea of where the stories left off. Now it’s time to don our tinfoil hats, make some predictions, and round up some of the best fan theories for season 6.</p><p><em>Click on the next image to get started…</em></p><p>[MAJOR BOOK SPOILERS FOLLOW]</p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>Lady Stoneheart will make her return</h2><img src="http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1544/15443861/3052274-screen+shot+2016-04-22+at+3.52.20+pm.png" /><br /><h3><p>If you’ve read the Game of Thrones books you’ve likely been waiting a while for the arrival of Lady Stoneheart, and we think season 6 is where she finally will make her appearance. Who is she? Well, after Catelyn Stark’s death at the hands of the Freys during the Red Wedding, she is resurrected by Beric Dondarrion.</p><p>If you’re not familiar with Beric, he’s the leader of an outlaw group called the Brotherhood without Banners. Beric himself has been killed and resurrected before, thanks to a red priest, Thoros of Myr.</p><p>In the books, Beric gives up his life for Catelyn’s and she’s resurrected as Lady Stoneheart, but the resurrection carries some complications. The reanimated Catelyn’s wounds aren’t healed fully, so her slit throat means she can’t talk, and in the process she loses some of herself: she’s consumed with rage and hellbent on revenge.</p><p>Lady Stoneheart becomes the new leader of the Brotherhood without Banners and proves to be a total badass. We really want to see her again.</p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>Cleganebowl</h2><img src="http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1544/15443861/3052276-the+mountain.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Next up is one of our favourite fan theories, Cleganebowl. If it ever happens, it will likely be in season 6. The theory supposes that the Clegane brothers: Sandor “The Hound” and Gregor “The Mountain” will end up fighting each other in an epic showdown to decide the fate of Cersei Lannister.</p><p>How? First, some backstory; The Hound’s face was scarred because, when the brothers were young, The Mountain pushed The Hound’s face into a fire. Ever since then The Hound has carried a phobia of fire, and has hated his brother for it.</p><p>The last we saw of Gregor was when he was poisoned during his fight with Oberyn Martell. The creepy Maester Qyburn promised to keep him alive, but said that the process may change him a bit. All we see of him is writhe under a sheet while being experimented on. At the end of season 5, we are introduced to the newest member of the Kingsguard, who is likely the reanimated Gregor.</p><p>At the end of season 4, The Hound was seemingly left for dead by Arya. Fans of the books have come up with the Gravedigger theory, which claims The Hound is rescued by a reputed healer known as the Elder Brother.</p><p>Brienne of Tarth hears about The Hound’s survival when meeting the Elder Brother in a place called the Quiet Isle. Brienne finds The Hound’s horse, which is famous for being essentially un-tamable, and then finds a man with a similar body and wounds to The Hound, who is digging graves. The theory is that The Hound is now part of the Faith as Sandor Clegane, having left his persona behind.</p><p>Later in the books, when Cersei gets arrested by the Sparrows, she chooses trial by combat. Her representative will be the The Mountain, and so the theory goes, the Faith’s representative will be the newly pious Sandor.</p><p>So, basically, Cleganebowl, get hype.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>We find out who Jon Snow’s mother is</h2><img src="http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1544/15443861/3052263-screen+shot+2016-04-22+at+3.41.57+pm.png" /><br /><h3><p>This is based on one of the biggest and most researched fan theories out there: Rhaegar + Lyanna = Jon.</p><p>This theory claims that Jon Snow isn’t Ned Stark’s bastard at all, but he’s still a Stark. The details are vague, but in the Game of Thrones books, it is told that Ned’s sister Lyanna runs off with (or is kidnapped by) Rhaegar Targaryen, the son of the mad king Aerys, and older brother of Daenerys. Rhaegar has not featured in the show before, but his kidnapping of Lyanna causes a bunch of problems, not least of which is that Lyanna is betrothed to Robert Baratheon.</p><p>Rhaegar’s actions trigger Robert’s rebellion, during which Rhaegar is killed by Robert at the Battle of the Trident, and the Mad King is stabbed in the back by Jaime Lannister. King’s Landing is then pulverised by the Lannister armies.</p><p>After this, Ned Stark sets off to find Lyanna, and tracks her to a strange place called the Tower of Joy, wherein he finds her in a pool of her own blood, and she ends up dying. It’s theorised that Ned actually found her after she’d given birth to the baby that we know to be Jon Snow. It’s not made clear what she died of, but it’s likely to be childbirth. After all, when Ned Stark returns to Winterfell, he has a baby in tow.</p><p>The full length trailer for season 6 seems to show a guy who looks a lot like Ned Stark (wearing a Targaryen crest and carrying the Stark shield). Obviously, considering Ned is super dead, this could easily be a flashback scene. Could this be the Tower of Joy? Could R+L=J finally be confirmed?</p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>Jamie will kill Cersei</h2><img src="http://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1544/15443861/3052277-9484642802-Game-.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Cast your mind back to season 5, where we saw a young Cersei and a friend visit Maggy the Frog, who tells her fortune. In the books, it’s made clear by Maester Qyburn that Maggy the Frog is actually Maggy the Maegi, a powerful maegi who uses dark bloodmagic in order to see into the future.</p><p>Maggy’s fortune wasn’t so fair for Cersei. It starts off good; She’ll marry the king, become queen, and have three beautiful children. That all happens. But she’s also told a younger, more beautiful woman will come to cast her down and take everything she holds dear. Basically, Margaery, or it could be Daenerys, or even Sansa.</p><p>“Gold shall be their crowns and gold their shrouds,” she said, meaning that all three of her children will die. Two of them are already dead, with Tommen the only remaining child left.</p><p>Then it gets even worse for Cersei: Maggy says: “And when your tears have drowned you, the Valonqar shall wrap his hands about your pale white throat and choke the life from you.”</p><p>Valonqar is high Valyrian for “little brother.” The obvious answer is it means Tyrion, which explains why Cersei is awful to him. But, she’s overlooking another little brother. Her lover and father of her children, Jaime.</p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>Jon Snow is not dead</h2><img src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1544/15443861/3052279-jonsnow_9possdw.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Jon Snow has got to be alive. And we're not just saying that because we're not ready to say goodbye to him and his beautiful floppy hair. There’s a bunch of theories as to how he could survive.</p><p>Some fans think that Jon warged (possessing another lifeform) out into the body of his direwolf Ghost. It’s been shown before that many of the Starks have been able to warg into other animals. Arya has done it before, as has Bran on several occasions. The theory is Jon can too. This process is easier if there’s a strong bond between the animal and the human, so it could be possible. In the books, Jon Snow has recurring dreams where he wargs into the body of his direwolf.</p><p>But another theory states that Melisandre brings him back. We know followers of the Lord of Light can do that, the red priest Thoros of Myr, who brought Beric Dondarrion back to life, being one such example. Melisandre thought that Stannis was the Chosen One, a reincarnated legendary warrior of light called Azor Ahai. Given that Stannis ended up being a bust, maybe Jon Snow is her new hope.</p><p>In A Dance With Dragons, she says this insightful line: "I pray for a glimpse of Azor Ahai, and R'hllor shows me only snow."</p><p> </p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>The Dragon has three heads</h2><img src="http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1544/15443861/3052281-house_targaryen_symbol_by_yurtigo-d7hmo3k.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>This final theory is probably the most far-fetched and hard to believe. This theory requires you to buy into the theory that Jon Snow is the son of Rhaegar. It also means one of our favourite characters, Tyrion, is also a Targaryen.</p><p>It’s theorised Tyrion’s father is actually secretly Aerys, the Mad King, who slept with Tywin’s wife Joanna.</p><p>Tywin, who is assumed to be the (now slain) father of Tyrion, was once the Hand for the Mad King Aerys. It’s already stated that Aeryn had a massive thing for Tywin’s wife Joanna. What if Joanna didn’t refuse Aeryn’s advances?</p><p>What’s interesting to note is that, in the books, Tyrion was born with a tail. There are also tales of Targaryen children born malformed, with one story stating that a Targaryen child was born with a tail.</p><p>So if Jon and Tyrion are also Targaryen, that brings us to the third head, Daenarys. Remember when Daenerys visited the House of the Undying? She sees a vision of a man who could be Rhaegar with a woman holding a baby; they say that the baby should be called Aegon and that he’s the prince who was promised (which, interestingly, could be another name for Azor Ahai). And it is said that his is the song of ice and fire. The man who resembles Rhaegar looks at Daenerys and says “there must be one more… the dragon has three heads”.</p><p>Daenerys has three dragons, and if you assume each requires a rider, that could be her, Jon, and if you buy into the A+J=T theory, Tyrion.</p><p>Which is why them meeting is so momentous.</p></h3></p><br/> <p><img src="http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1544/15443861/3052289-3051687-gamespotofthrones_promo_2016419.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>So, what do you reckon?

Unfortunately they aren’t very portable and are a pain to lug around. They’re also pretty much impossible to play on planes and trains. Luckily, gaming laptops have come a long way. They come in all different shapes, prices, and configurations. The downside here is that it can be a bit overwhelming shopping for a gaming laptop if you haven't done your research. That’s why we’re here to help. In the next few slides, you’ll find our 10 essential tips for buying a gaming notebook.</p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>Monitor</h2><img src="http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1568/15683559/3051870-display.png" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">There’s a lot to consider when looking at a laptop’s monitor. The most obvious aspect is the monitor’s size. A smaller 14-inch gaming laptop monitor will generally come in a more ultraportable form factor nowadays, whereas a 17- or even <a href="http://www.dell.com/us/p/alienware-18/pd">18-inch notebook</a> will most likely be not only heavier, but thicker as well. It will also come with more powerful components. This isn’t always the case, however, as vendors like <a href="https://www.msi.com/Notebook/GS70-STEALTH.html">MSI</a> and <a href="http://www.razerzone.com/gaming-systems/razer-blade-pro">Razer</a> do make thin 17-inch gaming laptops.</p><p dir="ltr">Perhaps more important than the pure physical size of the monitor is the panel’s resolution. 1080p is largely the standard here, and that’s actually the resolution we’d recommend for your laptop, if gaming is what you mostly aim to do with it. While there are some 4K gaming laptops out there, even more powerful desktop GPUs struggle to run games at 3840x2160, so you can imagine how hard it will be on their mobile GPU equivalents, which tend to run roughly 40% slower. Don’t get us wrong, 4K looks great for video viewing (for the limited 4K video content that’s out there), but it’s simply too taxing on hardware today to confidently recommend. For the time being, you’re better off saving the extra cashola. But what of 2560x1440 resolution, you ask? While 1440p panels may sound great, the majority of laptop vendors seem to have skipped that resolution, as it’s not very common outside of phones, tablets, and desktop monitors.</p><p dir="ltr">The next thing to consider about the monitor is whether or not it uses an IPS (in-plane switching) or TN (twisted nematic) panel. IPS panels usually come at a small premium, but it’s worth it as the added cost offers a much wider range of viewing angles and greater color accuracy. Not only do the colors “pop” more, but it makes them very useful in the professional photo/video editing scene. For reference, smartphones predominately use IPS displays.</p><p>The next thing to consider about panels is their refresh rate. If you have a 60Hz monitor (by far the most common refresh rate), it doesn’t matter if your GPU is able to render games at 100 frames per second, as your monitor will lock the FPS down to the refresh rate of your display. While it’s more common in the discrete monitor scene, some gaming laptops do offer higher than 60Hz refresh rates. The sexily named Sager NP9870-S offers a 75Hz display, which allows you to see up to 75fps. Beyond the static refresh rate, however, there is an emerging tech called variable refresh rate. This gives your monitor’s refresh control to your graphics card. What this means for you is smoother visible performance without any screen tearing, even at lower framerates. It can make 30fps look much smoother than it might otherwise. If you’ve never seen it before, this might sound like black magic, but it actually works! On the Nvidia side, there’s G-Sync, and on AMD’s side, there’s FreeSync.</p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>Trackpad</h2><img src="http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1568/15683559/3052416-trackpad.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>While you’ll most likely use a mouse when gaming, this doesn’t mean you should settle for a mediocre trackpad. Unfortunately, it’s really hard to gauge how well a trackpad feels unless you try it yourself. If you can’t try it out at a store or at a friend’s place, then look at some online reviews. You should also do research to see if it has all the bells and whistles that you’re looking for. Does it allow two-finger scrolling? Does it feature pinch-to-zoom? Does it have integrated buttons underneath the trackpad or are they separate, physical, discrete buttons? Some gaming laptops, like Alienware’s 14 series, even feature glowing trackpads. It’s definitely not super important, but it may satiate your Tron fixation.</p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>Keyboard</h2><img src="http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1568/15683559/3052417-rzrblade14-05.png" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">A good keyboard will offer a decent sense of actuation force and, like a desktop’s mechanical keyboard, should feel more tactile as a result. A bad laptop keyboard will feel mushy and squishy. These will occasionally make you second guess whether or not you actuated a certain key. While MSI makes a <a href="https://us.msi.com/Notebook/GT80-Titan-SLI-GTX-980M-SLI.html">crazy behemoth</a> of a gaming laptop with a mechanical keyboard, this is definitely not necessary and is certainly overkill.</p><p dir="ltr">Though not super important, many gaming keyboards also offer built-in lighting these days. This can help you type in the dark during those late-night gaming sessions. The fancier laptop keyboards will offer customizable RGB lighting. It’s a nice thing to have, but you shouldn’t feel the need to spend extra money for it.</p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>Speakers</h2><img src="http://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1568/15683559/3052418-sg70_32.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Nowadays it’s really hard to find horrendous speakers in gaming laptops. We are not suggesting they’ll all blow you away, but most of them do offer a decent amount of sonic punch. If you’re gaming, chances are you’ll use your own headset anyway, but it is worth noting that some gaming laptops come with subwoofers on the bottom, which give you some extra oomph.</p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>Size and weight</h2><img src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1568/15683559/3052423-razer-blade.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Contrary to popular belief, thinner is not always better. While a four-pound, .8-inch thick laptop is great for portability, thin gaming laptops are more prone to overheating and performance throttling. Plus, they’re generally less powerful than their behemoth brothers to begin with. Your laptop’s size can also impact the amount of noise it makes. The hotter a laptop gets, the louder the fans have to rev up to keep things cool. So it really comes down to what you’re looking for: If you’re looking to play relatively non-taxing games like League of Legends, Counter-Strike, and Dota 2 and want something portable, then by all means, go for the thin unit. If you want something that will play some of the more intensive games like Battlefield 4 and Metro Last Light and want more longevity out of your notebook (laptops that run hot all the time tend to die out quicker), going for the bulkier unit might be the better investment.</p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>Ports</h2><img src="http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1568/15683559/3052419-9570_image1.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">When buying a laptop, be sure to ask yourself if it has all the ports you need. Can it accommodate all the USB devices you intend to use? How many USB 3.0 ports vs. USB 2.0 ports does it have? Does it offer a USB type C connection? Does it have an SD card slot? What about HDMI/DisplayPort connectivity for your monitor? Ethernet port? Make sure not to overlook this factor when you’re shopping around.</p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>CPU</h2><img src="http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1568/15683559/3052421-cpu.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">For gaming, we recommend a quad-core laptop from Intel. A modern Skylake i7 is pretty commonplace in gaming laptops nowadays. Anything above four cores generally goes to waste when it comes to gaming today because games aren’t optimized for them. Besides the actual number of cores, another thing to look out for is processor frequency. This is how fast a CPU runs. For instance, the popular i7-6700HQ carries a base processor frequency of 2.6GHz, but will turbo up to its max frequency of 3.5GHz if need be. Beyond that, some Intel chips do feature hyperthreading, which is great for productivity, but has little-to-no impact on most games.</p><p dir="ltr">It is worth mentioning that some gaming laptop vendors are able to squeeze desktop CPUs into large laptop chassis (like the aforementioned <a href="http://www.sagernotebook.com/Notebook-NP9870-S.html">Sager NP9870-S</a>), but unless you’re looking for a desktop replacement, you’ll be paying a premium for overkill.</p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>RAM</h2><img src="http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1568/15683559/3052425-s-l1000.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>For gaming, make sure you’ve got 8GB of RAM or more. If you use Google Chrome a lot, that browser will eat as much RAM as you can chuck at it, so it wouldn’t be a bad idea to opt for 16GB. Anything above that is unnecessary for gaming and most productivity tasks. We also recommend setting up RAM to run in dual-channel mode. This means you have two sticks of RAM as opposed to one. While this might make it costlier to upgrade in the future, running in dual-channel offers greater RAM bandwidth. As for the speed of the RAM, as long as you’re running 1600MHz and above (which most gaming laptops will offer), you’ll be fine. While faster RAM speed can be more impactful for gaming on laptops that are simply running off of integrated graphics, this won’t really affect a gaming laptop with a discrete GPU.</p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>Graphics Cards</h2><img src="http://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1568/15683559/3052426-maxwell_gm204_die_3d_v17_final.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Speaking of discrete graphics, Nvidia seems to rule the roost when it comes to mobile GPUs. If you want to play at high settings for most games at 1080p, we recommend going with at least a GeForce GTX 970M, which has a base clock of 924MHz. If you wanted to try and max out games at that resolution, we recommend going with the GTX 980M, which has a base clock of 1038MHz. If you don’t need top-of-the-line performance, mid-tier GPUs like the 965M or 960M will do the job. If all you play is non-taxing games like Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and League of Legends, you won’t need all that much. A budget GTX 950M or even Intel’s Iris Pro integrated graphics will get you up and running just fine.</p><p dir="ltr">If you want uncompromising performance out of your laptop, however, or want something beefy enough to allow you to play VR games on the go, there are some thicker gaming laptops that have managed to squeeze in a full desktop GeForce GTX 980 GPU. They work surprisingly well, too, but you’ll definitely be paying a premium for them.</p><p>Another feature worth paying attention to is how much VRAM (video RAM) a mobile GPU has. Currently, 2GB of GDDR5 VRAM is good, and 4GBs and above is great. Having more VRAM comes in handy with handling game textures or when you’re gaming at really high resolutions (either natively or with a monitor plugged into your laptop).</p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>Storage</h2><img src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1568/15683559/3052428-sandisk_ssd_plus_angle-5fleft-5fhr.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Solid-state drives are a must. There’s a saying that I use: “Friends don’t let friends buy computers without SSDs,” and that applies to both desktops and laptops. Ideally, you’d have a 240GB-sized SSD or greater and then a supplemental hard drive for mass storage of your games.</p><p dir="ltr">If you can’t get a 240GB SSD or greater, you should get at least a 120GB for the operating system. This will allow your laptop to boot up much faster (think 14 seconds and under) and should feel much more responsive overall. Don’t fall for solid-state hybrid drives, though. These are essentially just hard drives with a small caching SSD on them. While they are marginally faster than strict HDDs, they are a far cry slower than pure solid-state drives.</p><p dir="ltr">If you want something even faster, you could get a laptop with two SSDs and have them configured in RAID 0. In RAID 0, you'd be prone to lose data on both drives if even one of them fails, but you'd have up to double the speed.</p><p dir="ltr">SSDs come in a variety of form factors, which include traditional 2.5-inch SSDs (like the ones you’d install in a desktop) or smaller mSata and M.2 form factors. Some M.2 SSDs are beginning to use the NVME protocol, which can be even faster than two traditional SSDs in RAID 0. But these are quite costly at the moment, and you’ll be fine with traditional SSDs for the time being.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br/>

<p><img src="http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/3051174-1.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Back in 2006, Marvel debuted what would go down as one of their best events to date: <em>Civil War</em>. The death of civilians during a super-powered battle forces the government to create a
]]>
<![CDATA[
superhuman registration act, in which registered super-powered beings in America would become paid government employees. However, they would also have to reveal their secret identities. Tony Stark ended up being for the act, while Captain America stood against it. The story forced heroes, villains, and readers to take sides: are they for registration or against it?</p><p><em>Civil War</em> was a huge story that had 7 main issues and over 100 tie-ins. It involved characters throughout the Marvel universe. That's too much story for one film, so its big screen counterpart won't be able to hit all the points the major points the comic mini-series could. Here are some key moments from the comic that won't appear in the film.</p><p><strong>Warning: There are spoilers for the <em>Civil War</em> comic ahead.</strong></p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>Nitro's Explosion</h2><img src="http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/3051191-2.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>The New Warriors, a superhero team with their own reality show, were filming an episode, when they came up against Nitro, a supervillain who can explode. During the battle, Nitro decided to take out the team by letting off a large explosion right in front of a school, killing heroes and civilians. Captain America estimated 800 to 900 casualties. There's a lot to introduce just to get this moment off the ground. None of the New Warriors exist in the Marvel cinematic universe and neither does Nitro. However, the events of <em>Age of Ultron</em>, with Ultron trying to destroy all of humanity by crashing a city into the planet, may be more than enough reason for a registration act to come into play.</p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>Uatu the Watcher Shows Up</h2><img src="http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/3051207-3.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Uatu the Watcher is a being that lives alone on the Moon. He is a member of an alien race that records knowledge by watching events unfold but never interfering. He's tall, he's bald, and he rarely talks, except for the few times where he breaks his "no interfering" rule. If Uatu shows up, something big is about to happen. It's a really bizarre concept to introduce to a movie with potentially a complex story about morality and heroes punching each other. More than anything, Uatu is an indicator to comic fans that what's coming down the road is going to be huge, but it's not necessary to the plot for the feature film.</p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>Anything Involving the X-Men</h2><img src="http://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/3051219-4.jpg" /><br /><h3><p><em>Civil War</em> embraced every corner of Earth in the Marvel Universe, even stretching into Wakanda, where Black Panther is from. Mutantkind, including the X-Men, were a larger part of this story. Wolverine and Cyclops were at ground zero after Nitro exploded. Eventually, Wolverine ended up fighting Nitro during the event, as Wolverine's healing factor could take on the blasts dealt by the villain. Fox owns the rights to Wolverine, the X-Men, and pretty much anything that's a mutant, except for a few instances like Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver. Fans should expect anything involving mutants to be missing from the film.</p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>Anything Involving the Fantastic Four</h2><img src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/3051222-5.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>While a lot of the focus of <em>Civil War</em> was on Tony Stark's team hunting down Captain America's team, one of the most interesting side stories took place with the Fantastic Four, mainly between Sue and Reed Richards, a married couple that didn't always see eye-to-eye. Reed was working closely with Tony Stark, but Sue didn't always believe in what Reed was doing, which led to some incredibly riveting moments during the story. Much like the X-Men, the Fantastic Four are owned by Fox, which is a real bummer considering that the team being included in this film would have been awesome.</p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>Spider-Man Revealing His Identity on Television</h2><img src="http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/3051259-11.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>During the <em>Civil War</em> story, Spider-Man joined up with Tony Stark and did the unthinkable: he revealed his identity on live television to show support for the Superhuman Registration Act. This is Spider-Man's first venture into the Marvel cinematic universe. Revealing his identity could easily be considered a bit "too soon" for the character, especially since this Peter Parker just became Spider-Man. In addition, while the moment was cool, it took a lot of silly plot devices to "undo" that moment, including a deal with the devil, Mephisto. While Spider-Man being a part of this story is important, this moment can be cut without taking too much away from the story.</p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>Robot Thor AKA Ragnarok</h2><img src="http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/3051248-6.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Prior to this story kicking off, Thor had died, so the heroes of the Marvel Universe were surprised to see the god of thunder return during <em>Civil War</em>, and they were more surprised to see him take Tony Stark's side. However, it turns out this Thor was actually a robot known as "Ragnarok." While this would be really cool to see in the film, <em>Civil War</em> wasn't a part of Chris Hemsworth's contract, so he won't be in it. Tony Stark may have a few tricks up his sleeves, but this won't be one of them.</p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>All the Deaths</h2><img src="http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/3051249-7.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>One of the biggest moments from <em>Civil War</em>, early on, was the death of Goliath. That wasn't the only death though. A whole slew of villains died as Punisher blasted his way into a room of bad guys who recently joined Captain America's cause. Because the Marvel cinematic universe doesn't have a plethora of characters that can be used as cannon fodder, don't expect much in the way of death in this film.</p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>Maria Hill's Team of Villains</h2><img src="http://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/3051606-13.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Maria Hill and S.H.I.E.L.D. felt they needed a little bit of help putting down the resistance against the Superhuman Registration Act, and there is no one better to recruit than a whole bunch of villains that are looking for redemption. Their first task was to take down Spider-Man, who turned on Tony Stark after the death of Goliath. It's pretty simple why this won't happen: there simply aren't enough villains kicking around for Hill to use. Could she employ villains like Crossbones and Zemo to take on Captain America? Most likely, but we will not be seeing the bad guy turned hero team known as the Thunderbolts.</p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>Negative Zone Prison</h2><img src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/3051255-9.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>What did Tony Stark and Reed Richards do with those who were against the Superhuman Registration Act? They locked them in the Negative Zone, which is a parallel antimatter universe. Heroes like Daredevil got to spent a stint in this jail for not registering as super humans. Obviously, that's a whole lot, concept-wise, to throw into the new film. Even more importantly, the Negative Zone is originally a Fantastic Four concept, so it's most likely a property of Fox.</p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>Daredevil and Punisher's Involvement</h2><img src="http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/3051256-10.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>The heroes and villains of the Marvel cinematic universe reach further than just the films. ABC's <em>Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</em> exists within that world, as well as all the Netflix series. Both Daredevil and Punisher play pretty big roles in the <em>Civil War</em> comic but don't expect them to pop up in the May film. Daredevil, Punisher, Jessica Jones, and the rest of the characters from the Netflix series are all contained within their own little pocket, like <em>Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</em> so expect a preexisting Marvel movie character to fill their roles.</p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>Bonus Moment We're Unsure About: The Death of Captain America</h2><img src="http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1562/15626911/3051260-12.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Many people consider then end of Civil War to be the death of Captain America, even though that moment happened a month after the conclusion of the story. Steve Rogers turned himself in after realizing how much damage the battle had caused and ended up getting shot by Crossbones while heading to trial. While everything in this list has to do with things that can't possibly happen in the upcoming film, Steve Rogers' death is a bit of a puzzler. Will Marvel go so far as to kill off the character? We're leaning towards no, but this is something that could possibly happen. </p></h3></p><br/>

Her final moments of the show depicted her walking across King's Landing, stripped naked with her hair shaved, pelted with waste from amassed onlookers, as part of an arranged public humiliation ordered by the High Sparrow.</p><p dir="ltr">Ironically, it was Cersei who cultivated High Sparrow's rise to power in King's Landing, as part of a wider plot to dismantle the Tyrells' standing. To that end it worked, but the popular religious leader, having been granted military powers, arrested Cersei on long-running rumours of adultery and incest.</p><p>Cersei concedes that a confession of adultery to the High Sparrow, and a subsequent walk of shame, is her only path to freedom. Her final moment in season 5 shows her covered in filth as she returns to the Red Keep. She is consoled by Maester Qyburn and cradled in the arms of the newest member of the Kingsguard, who is very likely to be the resurrected and mutated body of The Mountain. The scene ends with her looking back at the filth-splattered path she walked, and the High Sparrow's followers, with an envenomed glare.</p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>Daenerys Targaryen</h2><img src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1544/15443861/3051609-episode-10.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">The majority of Daenerys's story up to season 4 covered her extraordinary rise to power, from traded wife to the miraculous parent of three dragons, to the commander of the Unsullied, and ultimately as the ruler of Meereen. Season 5 depicts her political capitulation, having lost the confidence of Meereen's people after finding herself at odds with their customs and culture.</p><p dir="ltr">Making matters worse, she was constantly under threat of execution from the Sons of the Harpy, an insurgent group who attempted to take her life on several occasions. With each failed murder the Sons came closer, having vanquished Daenerys's trusted guard and adviser Ser Barristan, and gravely wounding the Unsullied commander Grey Worm.</p><p dir="ltr">At the conclusion of season 5's penultimate episode, The Sons of the Harpy have Daenerys surrounded in an amphitheatre, but she escapes to the sky after Drogon, her most senior and disobedient dragon, swoops in to save her.</p><p>Drogon takes her to a vast stretch of fields and mountains, of which the location is unknown. Soon afterwards she is ambushed by a khalasar of Dothraki. In seasons 1 and 2, a clan of Dothraki had worshipped her as Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea. But this unknown clan’s standing with her is deliberately not made clear (although in season 6 trailers it is suggested she is held captive). Unsure of her fate, Daenerys drops her ring in the grassy fields to leave a trail.</p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>Tyrion Lannister</h2><img src="http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1544/15443861/3051621-video-undefined-26c82f3000000578-403_636x358.jpg" /><br /><h3><p><span>Few characters have travelled The Seven Kingdoms quite like Tyrion. His story has taken him to virtually every major location between The Wall at the coldest north and sun-kissed Meereen in the deepest south.</span></p><p dir="ltr">Tyrion's mark can be found at many of these iconic locations. He cunningly saved King's Landing at the Battle of Blackwater Bay, then married Sansa Stark under duress, was later wrongfully convicted of assassinating King Joffrey, lost a trial by combat that appeared to seal his fate, and still managed to escape after killing his father, and his lover Shae. In season 5 he fled to Meereen, before being captured by Ser Jorah Mormont, after which both of them were seized and traded by slavers, before meeting Daenerys and becoming her adviser. It is a miracle that his heart still beats.</p><p>After Daenerys's escape from Meereen, he is left as caretaker of the city, along with Varys.</p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>Jorah, Missandei, Grey Worm, Daario Naharis</h2><img src="http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1544/15443861/3051624-screen+shot+2016-04-21+at+6.04.04+pm.png" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Along with Tyrion, these four loyal servants of Daenerys are left reeling from her escape from Meereen. It's likely they can still govern the city, with the Unsullied having ensured some control over its people. The real question is who stays to restore order in Meereen and who departs to search for their queen.</p><p>Jorah, who in one season 6 trailer appears to have found Daenerys's ring, may be the only one of the four looking for her. That in itself carries some troubling questions, as Jorah is shown in season 5 to have caught the usually fatal (and extremely infectious) greyscale disease.</p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>Jon Snow</h2><img src="http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1544/15443861/3051632-screen+shot+2016-04-21+at+6.11.47+pm.png" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Jon Snow is dead, probably. Or at the very least, if you want to split hairs, Jon Snow was killed. Or possibly, there was an attempt on his life. Nothing is certain. </p><p dir="ltr">The grim reaper has smiled on the Bastard of Winterfell virtually from the outset of the show, but the resourceful and honour-bound Crow has managed to survive all threats and battles, up until the end of season 5.</p><p dir="ltr">His downfall began when elected as the 998th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. His grand plan, to forge an alliance with the Wildlings that his people had been fighting for generations, was perhaps Snow's best chance to resist the looming invasion of the White Walkers. But his radical ploy, to let the Free Folk walk through the northernmost border of the Seven Kingdoms and settle in the land, was deemed treachery by his brothers.</p><p dir="ltr">At the conclusion of season 5, he is lured from his chambers by his protégé Olly, and is subsequently stabbed multiple times by Ser Alliser Thorne and other rebels within The Night's Watch.</p><p dir="ltr">The final moments of season 5 show him bleeding out. How his likely death plays into season 6 has become the subject of intense speculation from fans...</p><p> </p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>Melisandre</h2><img src="http://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1544/15443861/3051635-screen+shot+2016-04-21+at+6.16.18+pm.png" /><br /><h3><p><span>...which brings us to Melisandre, the red priestess who has demonstrated both a lust for those bound for power as well has her own supernatural abilities. Just before Jon Snow's assassination, she is seen arriving at Castle Black.</span></p><p dir="ltr">Season 5 showcases the deep shortcomings of Melisandre's powers; her visions of Stannis Baratheon claiming the throne were deeply misplaced. Her beliefs that burning Shireen Baratheon alive would secure his victory were proven profoundly false. Fearing defeat, she absconds from Stannis's disastrous campaign to take Winterfell. Her arrival at Castle Black is deliberately left ambiguous.</p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>Bran Stark, Meera Reed, Hodor</h2><img src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1544/15443861/3051650-bran-stark-hodor.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Bran is the first major character who was absent for an entire season in Game of Thrones, having not featured at all in S5.</p><p dir="ltr">He had played a key role in the four seasons prior, with his story taking him off the beaten path, heading north of Winterfell on a wild-goose chase, following the path of a three-eyed Raven that appears in his dreams.</p><p dir="ltr">Bran, along with Hodor, Meera and Jojen Reed, eventually come to a giant weirwood tree containing the Three-Eyed Raven, as foretold in one of Bran's visions. Suddenly, the group is attacked by Wights (Jojen is killed), before a Child of the Forest leads them away to a cave that, interestingly, radiates a magical power that kills Wights as soon as they enter it.</p><p dir="ltr">Inside the cave, the Three-Eyed Raven reveals himself to be a Greenseer, a title given to those who possess magical powers including the ability to see into the future. At the conclusion of his story in season 4, Bran asks the Three-Eyed Raven if he can be made to walk again.</p><p>He is told he cannot walk, but soon will be able to fly.</p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>Arya Stark</h2><img src="http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1544/15443861/3051651-cdegdkl.png" /><br /><h3><p><span>Ned Stark's feisty and vengeful daughter's path home has deviated so many times that her quest, and indeed her past, has faded in the process. Many of the people she sought to kill to</span></p><p dir="ltr">avenge her father (and subsequently the majority of her family) are already dead, while her family ties have slowly been killed off.</p><p dir="ltr">By the end of season 5, Arya was perhaps more lost than ever. As a student of Jaqen H'ghar, learning the dark arts of the assassin, her sense of sight has been taken away from her, perhaps as a way to train her other senses, but also as a punishment for insubordination.</p><p>Her sin was killing Meryn Trant, in an act of revenge for killing her former sword instructor Syrio Forel. But the assassination of one of her targets was a contravention of H’ghar’s cult, as she is forbidden to take a life that wasn't hers to take, and also stole a face to wear as a disguise in order to get close to Meryn. In the aftermath she was blinded, though this was not just a punishment, as depriving her senses is a key stage in her training as an assassin.</p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>Lady Sansa and Theon of Greyjoy</h2><img src="http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1544/15443861/3051653-game-thrones-season-6-predictions-and-spoilers.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">The unrelenting tragedies of both these characters ends in season 5 with the two united again, jumping off a wall in Winterfell, as part of a desperate bid to escape the recently legitimised Ramsay Bolton.</p><p dir="ltr">Although the show doesn't answer whether either survived the fall, a season 6 trailer shows both running through the woods hand-in-hand, seemingly not particularly injured by the drop. Other snippets and trailers appear to suggest Theon has been caught, while Sansa escaped.</p><p dir="ltr">Considering the horror scenes of Theon's captivity at the hands of Ramsay (castration, sleeping in a kennel, psychological dismantling), how he will be treated if Ramsay recaptures him could lower the show to even darker scenes of depravity.</p><p dir="ltr">Sansa's next steps are unclear. She was married into the Boltons by Baelish, who convinced her that this will be an opportunity for her to enact revenge on the men who had a hand in killing so many people in her family.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>Brienne of Tarth</h2><img src="http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1544/15443861/3051657-screen+shot+2016-04-21+at+6.32.18+pm.png" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Brienne concludes her story in season 5 by dealing a fatal blow to a wounded Stannis Baratheon. Battling with him and his mercenary army was not her first choice, but more a matter of necessity due to Baratheon's march onto Winterfell.</p><p dir="ltr">Brienne was watching over Winterfell on the lookout for Sansa, as earlier in the season she swore allegiance to her, as part of a promise to Sansa's mother, Catelyn Stark.</p><p dir="ltr">Now that Sansa appears to have escaped Winterfell, Brienne's next steps are not perfectly clear, though she is still sworn to find her.</p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>Jaqen H’ghar</h2><img src="http://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1544/15443861/3051661-jaqen-coin-.jpg" /><br /><h3><p><span>The Faceless Man of Braavos is the grindstone sharpening Arya Stark’s blade of justice. Having met her in King’s Landing, he smuggles her out after the execution of her father, Ned Stark. The mysterious assassin then takes her in as his apprentice and the two spend much of season 5 at the House of Black and White, where he teaches her how to become “no one.”</span></p><p dir="ltr">His training methods seem to be inconsequential tasks such as sweeping floors and bathing dead bodies, but, over time, he reveals that it was all in aid of teaching Arya to expunge her previous identity. He wants her to become a blank canvas on which another person can be painted.</p><p dir="ltr">H’ghar asks Arya to dispose of Needle, the blade given to her by brother Jon Snow, and thereby cast aside one of the remaining anchors to her former life. He then shows her the Hall of Faces, a cavernous chamber lined with great stone pillars. Within each of these are hundreds of faces, all which the Faceless Men can assume.</p><p dir="ltr">Although he deems Arya is not ready to become “no one,” he allows her to become “someone else” in order to track and poison The Thin Man, a businessman on the docks. Arya abandons her mission and instead kills Meryn Trant, who murdered her sword-fighting instructor Syrio Forel back in King’s Landing.</p><p dir="ltr">She is judged by H’ghar as violating the code of the Faceless Men for taking a life that was not hers to take. As penance he drinks the vial of deadly poison he gave Arya and falls to the floor. Arya reaches down to H’ghar’s body and begins to pull off many faces, until she reaches her own. Gazing upon her own visage she goes blind. Nearby, H’ghar re-emerges, this time in the body of The Waif, another acolyte of House of Black and White.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>Ramsay and Roose Bolton</h2><img src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1544/15443861/3051665-maxresdefault.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Considering the Bolton's command of Winterfell was under threat from Stannis Baratheon, the unfolding developments of season 5 were relatively fortunate for the pair, albeit deplorable. Ramsay gets legitimised by Roose, then marries Sansa (after which he rapes her), then undermines Stannis's attack by destroying his horses and food tents with just twenty good men.</p><p dir="ltr">But after crushing Stannis's army, the Boltons return to Winterfell to find that Theon and Sansa have absconded, and Ramsay's mistress Myranda has been killed in the process. How they enact revenge, and if they are able to, could be a key story of season 6.</p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>Jaime Lannister</h2><img src="http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1544/15443861/3051668-jaime-lannister.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Jaime concludes season 5 on a ship voyage back to King's Landing with his daughter Myrcella aboard, apparently having secured her safe passage from Dorne.</p><p dir="ltr">But Myrcella is killed from a poison administered to her lips by Ellaria Sand. How Jamie and Myrcella's mother Cersei respond to this will likely be a key plot point in season 6.</p><p>In one trailer for season 6, Jaime is shown saying to Cersei, "Everything they have taken from us we're going to take back and more." This threat could be aimed at The High Sparrow, however, as Jaime is also shown with a platoon of armed guards outside the Sept of Baelor.</p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>Varys</h2><img src="http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1544/15443861/3051669-tyrion-varys-meereen.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>In season 5 the Spider of Westeros flees King’s Landing for Pentos, taking Tyrion with him at the behest of his brother, Jaime. While there, he reveals his machinations have all been in aid of returning the Targaryens to the Iron Throne and believes the sharp-minded dwarf could be the guiding hand Daenerys needs. Varys and Tyrion leave Pentos and begin their journey to Meereen, hiding Tyrion in a wooden box to avoid attracting attention to him, which would be problematic given that he had just murdered one of the most powerful man in Westeros, his father, Tywin Lannister.</p><p dir="ltr">Stopping off at Volantis, Varys lets Tyrion out briefly and the two explore the markets. This proves to be a mistake, as Tyrion is promptly kidnapped by Jorah, who delivers him to Daenerys in the hopes that he will regain her favour. He doesn’t.</p><p dir="ltr">Tyrion reveals Varys is loyal to the last of the Targaryens, a story she is reticent to believe considering he also attempted to have her assassinated. She is told that Varys did this in order to protect himself which, in turn, allowed him to ensure Daenerys’s safety.</p><p dir="ltr">Varys eventually reconnects with Tyrion, who has been taken on by Daenerys as her advisor. The master of secrets pledges to help Tyrion and Daenerys to ensure they maintain control over Meereen, a city on the verge of tearing itself apart.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>Littlefinger, Petyr Baelish</h2><img src="http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1544/15443861/3051670-littlefinger.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>The Iago character of Game of Thrones has a weakness for weaving elaborate webs to exploit others and mask his intentions, but he's beginning to come unstuck.</p><p dir="ltr">After marrying Sansa Stark into the Boltons at Winterfell, in season 5 he returns to King's Landing and, after having discovered the Sparrows have destroyed his brothels, meets with Cersei.</p><p dir="ltr">She explains her desire to take Winterfell from the Boltons, upon which Littlefinger reminders her that he is the Lord of the Vale. His bargain is simple; if he takes Winterfell, he would like to be made Warden of the North.</p><p dir="ltr">Cersei explains that she wants to see Sansa's head on a spike, which, if you believe Littlefinger is sympathetic to the plight of Ned Stark's daughter (it is strongly implied he is falling in love with her), makes his mission a little more complex.</p><p>Things worsen still, as Olenna Tyrell asks Littlefinger to help free her grandchildren--Margaery and Loras--from the High Sparrow's imprisonment (which, complicating matters further, Cersei had partly orchestrated). Olenna threatens Littlefinger, explaining that if he does not help, she will expose his hand in King Joffrey's murder.</p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>The High Sparrow</h2><img src="http://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1544/15443861/3051671-maxresdefault+%281%29.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">The High Sparrow's rise to power culminates in season 5, with Cersei anointing him as High Septon and later restoring the Faith Militant; an order that allows him to dispense justice and bear arms.</p><p dir="ltr">His new powers were administered without mercy, having imprisoned Margaery Tyrell for lying to the gods, along with Cersei for adultery. At the conclusion of season five, he sets Cersei free after she confesses adultery, but not before she takes a deeply humiliating walk of shame, naked, across King's Landing.</p><p>Various trailers for season six show that Cersei and Jaime Lannister resisting the High Sparrow and his Sparrows, suggesting a civil war is on the cards.</p></h3></p><br/> <p><img src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1544/15443861/3051674-mountain.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>This fearsome warrior formally known as Gregor Clegane was poisoned in a fight to the death with Oberyn Martell, upon which he was presumed dead. It is implied he survived after being experimented on, Frankenstein-style, by the crazed alchemist Qyburn. Introduced only as “the newest member of the king’s guard”, this mutated monster has become Cersei's key guard. Trailers for season 6 have teased he will be set loose on the Sparrows as his master seeks to regain control of King's Landing.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>Tommen Baratheon</h2><img src="http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1544/15443861/3051676-11541e1c-16a8-4e96-8dc2-c262d6193310.jpg" /><br /><h3><p><span>This mild mannered King of the Seven Kingdoms is manipulated by his closest allies, from his mother Cersei to his (now imprisoned) wife Margaery. He has vowed to free Margaery from captivity at the hands of The High Sparrow, but was talked out of it by Cersei. He's now in a strop.</span></p><p> </p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>Margaery Baratheon</h2><img src="http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1544/15443861/3051677-vlcsnap-2015-05-26-23h10m43s247_edited.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Captured by the high Sparrow in season 5 for lying to the gods at a trial. Both Tommen and her grandmother Olenna want her freed. A trailer for season 6 shows her bowing before The High Sparrow.</p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>Olenna Tyrell</h2><img src="http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1544/15443861/3051678-olenna-tyrell-1024.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> In a move that seems out of character for the methodical Olenna, she begins to play a dangerous game by giving Littlefinger an ultimatum: Free her grandchildren Margaery and Loras from the High Sparrow, or she will reveal Littlefinger's hand in the assassination of King Joffrey.</p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>Stannis, Shireen, and Selyse Baratheon</h2><img src="http://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1544/15443861/3051679-1ded0cd472a912ba217d6867fcd5efda.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Stannis's fate is sealed. He burned his daughter Shireen alive at the behest of Melisandre to secure victory over the Boltons of Winterfell. That, in hindsight, was a spectacular failure. His army of mercenaries, funded by the Iron Bank of Braavos, largely desert him due to both the appalling scene of sacrifice, along with the impossibly cold snow storm that has engulfed them.</p><p>Later he discovers his wife has committed suicide (or has been hung by the mercenaries). Melisandre deserts him too, and the remaining few men left are swept up by the Bolton army. Hiding in the woods, Stannis is found by Brienne of Tarth, who appears to kill him.</p></h3></p><br/> <p><img src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1544/15443861/3051680-screen+shot+2016-04-21+at+6.51.12+pm.png" /><br /><h3><p>Having rode to Winterfell seeking Jon Snow's support in fighting with Stannis, he discovers his king has died after Melisandre arrives at Winterfell. In one of the season 6 trailers, he appears to be protecting Jon Snow's corpse from other members of the Night's Watch.</p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>Bronn</h2><img src="http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1544/15443861/3051681-bronn.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>In season 5, Bronn was poisoned whilst on a failed mission to safely return Myrcella Lannister to King's Landing. At the same time got real close with his assassin Tyene Sand, who gave him an antidote in exchange for saying she is the most beautiful woman he has ever met.</p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>Ellaria Sand, Doran Martell, Trystane Martell</h2><img src="http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1544/15443861/3051682-tumblr_inline_mqih0nq5ik1qz4rgp.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Ellaria, having pledged fealty to Prince Doran of Dorne, goes against his wishes and kills Myrcella Lannister as an act of revenge for the death of Oberyn Martell. How Doran responds, knowing that his son Trystane is in the Lannister's custody, is unknown.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>The White Walkers</h2><img src="http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1544/15443861/3051685-1508_promo_stills_12001692731.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>For five seasons now Game of Thrones has teased their invasion into Westeros (S3 ended with a shot of them approaching the Wall), and while the dreaded invasion still hasn't arrived, season 5 provided a dramatic demonstration of the White Walker's lethality.</p><p>The battle of Hardhome offered insight into the White Walker's powers to reanimate and possess their victims, as well as their internal hierarchy. A luring shot of the Night's King at the end of the Hardhome scene was perhaps the most foreboding White Walker scene yet. Make no mistake, winter is coming.</p></h3></p><br/> <p><img src="http://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1544/15443861/3051687-gamespotofthrones_promo_2016419.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Don't forget to check out our all-new<a href="http://www.gamespot.com/shows/gamespot-of-thrones"> GameSpot of Thrones</a> show, which goes live every Monday after the show, providing episode analysis, answers to questions, news, reaction, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">Check it out<a href="http://www.gamespot.com/shows/gamespot-of-thrones"> here</a>.</p></h3></p><br/>

<![CDATA[
<p><h2>A Full Roster (With More Characters on the Way)</h2><img src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1197/11970954/3050469-13040908_10154229645692147_6009859122931479087_o.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>One of the most exciting aspects of a new Street Fighter game is who's in it. From Ryu to M. Bison, here's all the confirmed characters in <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/street-fighter-v">Street Fighter V</a>. With the game out now, we'll also be updating this gallery further with all the post-launch DLC characters.</p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>Guile</h2><img src="http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1197/11970954/3050466-12983815_10154229647892147_8759907561721562217_o.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Guile returns as the second DLC character in Street Fighter V. Originally introduced in Street Fighter II, this U.S Air Force pilot has been a franchise mainstay and icon for years, having appeared in a majority of the mainline series entries. Guile's appearance here marks the first time in nearly two decades that he has appeared in a Street Fighter game alongside Charlie Nash, his former comrade and best friend. This should be a big deal for fans, seeing as Guile's primary motivation over the years has been getting back at M. Bison for murdering Nash during the events of Street Fighter Alpha. And with the way Nash looks now, inevitable drama is bound to follow.</p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>Alex</h2><img src="http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1552/15524586/3020018-12841403_10154093935167147_5963995914594385939_o.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Alex was first introduced in 1997's Street Fighter III and has only made appearances in that entry's subsequent editions. He's an American fighter from Manhattan, New York, who lost his parents at a young age. Taken into the custody by a man named Tom--a military veteran and close friend of his father's--Alex was raised to be a fighter, learning a unique style that combines wrestling and kick boxing. As the first of six post-launch DLC characters featured in Street Fighter V, Alex is an interesting new addition to the roster with a moveset that includes a powerful Powerbomb throw and plenty of midrange attacks.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>Ryu</h2><img src="http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1365/13658182/2882384-03_ryu_vtrigger_critical_art_1434027508.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Ryu is back once again in the roster of Street Fighter V. Having been in every game in the series since its arcade debut in 1987, Ryu is considered Street Fighter's most recognizable character. He is a practitioner of Shotokan-style Karate and mostly spends his life alone wandering from town to town looking for challenging opponents to fight. Ryu's primary ambition in life is to become the strongest fighter he can possibly be.</p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>Ken</h2><img src="http://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1197/11970954/2901978-10_critical_art.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Ken, the best friend, rival, and former sparring partner of Ryu, is back in Street Fighter V. Alongside Ryu, Ken is a longtime series character who has also appeared in every single major Street Fighter game. Despite being trained under the same master as Ryu, Ken differs from him in his more fiery and rambunctious personality. But like Ryu, Ken also wants to find a challenging opponent to help him become stronger. However, he often grapples with this desire because he doesn’t want to jeopardize the safety of his family.</p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>Cammy</h2><img src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1197/11970954/2886278-09_cammy_intro.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Cammy first debuted as a playable character in Super Street Fighter II and has since appeared in both Street Fighter Alpha and Street Fighter IV. She used to work for Shadaloo as one of M. Bison's brainwashed servants. However, after successfully breaking free, she was stricken with amnesia. Slowly regaining her memories ever since, Cammy now works an operative of Delta Red, a counter-terrorism task force for MI6.</p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>M. Bison</h2><img src="http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1197/11970954/2872794-01_-_intro.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>A visibly older version of the treacherous Street Fighter antagonist M. Bison is appears in Street Fighter V. M. Bison has been a playable character in nearly every single game in the series with the exception of the first and third games. He is the leader of a crime syndicate known as Shadaloo and is the wielder of an evil energy known as Psycho Power. Being the evil man that he is, M. Bison is the instigator of several grudges from many characters in the series, such as Chun-Li, Guile, and Cammy. His main goal is to rule the world at any cost for his own selfish benefits.</p></h3></p><br/> <p><h2>Charlie</h2><img src="http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/536/5360430/2816199-1_bmp_jpgcopy.jpg" /><br /><h3>Charlie is a fighter who has been very much a part of the Street Fighter lore for quite some time. He was central to Guile's backstory in Street Fighter II, but never appeared in the game. However, he eventually made an official appearance as a playable fighter in Street Fighter Alpha. As Guile's military comrade, Charlie has many of the same techniques, such as the "Sonic Boom" and "Flash Kick." As lore would have it, Charlie suffered an early death during the end of Street Fighter Alpha, although the official canon explanation of how he died is unclear.</h3></p><br/> <p><h2>Chun-Li</h2><img src="http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1365/13658182/2882391-10_chunli_vtrigger_1434027517.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>As a constantly recurring series character, Chun-Li has appeared in all of its games except Street Fighter and the first two editions of Street Fighter III.
